In August 2018 a joint project between the BBC England Data Unit, BBC Shared Data Unit and BBC Sport reported on the finances of football clubs across England. A lead piece focused on the fact that [more than half of Premier League clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44850888) in the first season of the current broadcast deal, while [a follow up piece looked at the widening gap between the Premier League and EFL](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44981103) and a [further story focused on an interview about the findings with Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45085844).

Our analysis found:

* The median average turnover among Premier League clubs was £133m higher than those in the Championship, according to clubs' most recent accounts
* In 2017, 14 out of 23 Championship clubs spent more than 100% of their turnover on staff costs, including their players, coaches, management and administrators
* Barnsley did not disclose that detail in their 2017 accounts
* Between 2014 and 2017, Championship clubs' median average turnover increased by £4.8m to £23.7m, League One's rose by £1.9m to £6.3m and League Two's dropped by £300,000 to £3.2m
* The Premier League's highest-paid director, believed to be executive chairman Richard Scudamore, received £2.5m in "broadcasting bonuses" in the year ending 2016, when the record TV rights deal was agreed - more than the margin by which League One and League Two clubs increased their turnovers from 2014-17

The story was two years in the making, beginning in October 2016, as Alex Homer, Andrew Aloia and Paul Bradshaw trawled through every single league club's accounts compiling and analysing data on their income, spending, webs of ownership and league position.

The accounts – four years of sets of accounts for 92 clubs changing each season - had to be read and data inputted manually because the accounts are published online as scanned PDFs. The resulting spreadsheet now contains more than 17,000 pieces of data.

With extra help on the analysis from Dan Wainwright and Paul Bradshaw in the England Data Unit and Pete Sherlock in the Shared Data Unit, and expert guidance and subbing from Steve Marshall, the result was a [piece](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44850888) that had over 2m views and which was followed up by other outlets, as well as coverage on 5Live, BBC World, R4, R2, BBC Breakfast, The Six, the News Channel and 19 GNS interviews.
